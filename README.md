A node web app for sharing what food you enjoy with friends and family.

The idea of this is to learn node.js and angular.js by creating an app to share food with friends and family. I love food and like trying new foods, but want to be able to share these new foods with friends and family without the usual instagram upload.

Plan so far:

Create a node.js server that will handle all of the data

#Routes
	/api
	/api/foods
	/api/foods/food_id
	/api/users

Create a frontend (single page app) with angular.js
